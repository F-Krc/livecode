## Live-Repository
The live-repository  contains live code and documentation. Its structure follows the curriculumns main-modules (BDL, UIB, ...). The content of the main-module folders is then organized as a diary, where the subfolders start with the date, followed by some keywords to indicate the day's main topics.

### Structure
